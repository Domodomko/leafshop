      "about_tea": "<p>Tea (THEA SINENSIS o CAMELIA SINENSIS) is an evergreen plant of the Camellia family. Botanists recognize two very similar varieties: Chinese, Assam, and the Cambodian subspecies, all used for commercial production.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCamellia Sinensis, in its Chinese variety, can reach a height of 3 to 4.5 meters and is widespread throughout China, Tibet and Japan. It tolerates low temperatures, producing leaves of about 6 cm in length and can live up to 100 years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCamellia Assamica is more a tree than a bush and can reach a height of 13 meters, with leaves of about 15 cm in length. This variety thrives in tropical climates and has a productive life of about 40 years. The subspecies most used for the production of hybrids (crosses between different varieties) is the Cambodian Camellia (Camellia assamica, lasiocalix subspecies), which can also grow to a height of up to 4.5 metres.</p>",
      "camelia": "<p>The tea plant, in plantations, is usually pruned to maintain its shrub form, with a greater ability to constantly produce new buds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the outset the &quot;&quot;pruning&quot;&quot; is designed to give the top of the plant a flat shape: this will make it easier to grow new buds, which represent one of the fundamental aspects of the various harvests. Tea is like a fine wine or a good oil, i.e. the taste and quality of the final product depends on many factors, such as climate, soil, altitude, weather conditions, the method of harvesting and handling, mixing, packaging, transport and storage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTea plantations are usually called gardens, especially in India, in the areas of Darjeeling and Assam, where there is a very important distinction that determines the value of the tea based on the garden of origin.</p>",
      "names_of_tea": "<p>Before the English word &ldquo;tea&rdquo; came about, the leaves had a variety of different names: tcha, cha, tay and tee. The English name does not come from the Mandarin Chinese, Tcha, but from the Amoy dialect, te, assimilated during the first contacts between the Chinese and Dutch traders in the port of Amoy in the Fujian province. That name became &ldquo;thee&rdquo; in Dutch, and the Dutch having been the first to import tea to Europe, it then became &ldquo;tee&rdquo; in German.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Spanish, Italian, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Hungarian it is written &ldquo;t&eacute;&rdquo;, in English &ldquo;tea&rdquo;, in French &ldquo;th&eacute;&rdquo;, in Finnish &ldquo;tee&rdquo;, in Latvian &ldquo;teja&rdquo;, in Korean &ldquo;ta&rdquo;, in Tamil &ldquo;tey&rdquo;, in Sinhala &ldquo;thay&rdquo; and in scientific language &ldquo;thea&rdquo;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Mandarin &ldquo;cha&rdquo; became &ldquo;ch&#39;a&rdquo; in Cantonese and was translated into Portuguese as &ldquo;cha&rdquo; (at the time of Portuguese trade with the Cantonese-speaking city of Macao) and then into Persian, Japanese and Hindi, becoming &ldquo;shai&rdquo; in Arabic, &ldquo;ja&rdquo; in Tibetan, &ldquo;chay&rdquo; in Turkish and &ldquo;chai&rdquo; in Russian.</p>",
      "black_tea": "<p>To produce this variety of tea, fresh Camelia Sinensis leaves go through a process of oxidation and transform from their original green colour to a dark brown colour, giving their aroma a more complex quality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe end product has a chestnut brown or amber colour and features a strong body and flavour profile. Black tea&rsquo;s oxidation promotes the release of caffeine when infused, making it the most stimulating variety.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProperties of Black Tea:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Stimulates the mind</li>\r\n\t<li>Reduces blood cholesterol</li>\r\n\t<li>Helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases</li>\r\n\t<li>Strengthens the immune system</li>\r\n\t<li>High fluoride content, which prevents cavities and strengthens tooth enamel</li>\r\n\t<li>Strengthens bones</li>\r\n\t<li>Antioxidant: fights the effects of free radicals</li>\r\n</ul>",
      "green_tea": "<p>Oxidation of the tea leaves is prevented by rapid blanching to deactivate the oxidase enzyme. The resulting tea is light-bodied, slightly herbal, fresh and vegetal tasting, and features yellowish, greenish or golden tones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProperties of Green Tea:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Fights the effect of free radicals</li>\r\n\t<li>Prevents aging</li>\r\n\t<li>Improves the appearance of the skin</li>\r\n\t<li>Strengthens hair and nails</li>\r\n\t<li>Prevents cardiovascular diseases</li>\r\n\t<li>Promotes fat burning</li>\r\n\t<li>Improves brain function</li>\r\n\t<li>Stimulates the diuretic effect</li>\r\n\t<li>Regulates blood pressure</li>\r\n</ul>"
